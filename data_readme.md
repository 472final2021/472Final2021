# Data ReadMe

### For our final project, we used the following dataset:
1. tickers.csv 
    1. The tickers.csv file contains the tickers in the major US exchanges (NASDAQ, NYSE, AMEX) downloaded from the NASDAQ website. It is a  list of publicly traded US stock tickers which is used like a library. For each data scrap category, it is crucial to have the ticker list for counting the frequencies a ticker is mentioned in order to generate the top mentioned tickers.
